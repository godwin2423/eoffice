# Circular Frontend

This is a small Vite + React app that provides a content editor and posts the data to the backend to generate the circular HTML.

Install and run:

```powershell
cd d:\AI\Templates\circular-react\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default the frontend posts to `http://localhost:4000`. To change the backend URL set env var `VITE_API_BASE` before running Vite.
